# project rootNoob Deus (Q*)  
*initially focussing on Qubes development (hence the Q)  

Development with a radically different business model*.  
We charge only for the 'time-target bonus' - everything else is on a cost-basis.  

However, there is one important caveat:  
*all of our work done must be public and open-source with [non-restrictive licences](acceptable-licence-list.md).  

See the [timetable](dev-time-split-table.md) for exciting info.


Open Source, Always*:
All work done must be open-source
All our financials are transparent
Our clients & projects are open-source/transparent

*:
**Once the client & ourselves have agreed** the project is complete, there will be a **6 month delay** between releasing code & project docs etc  
Corporate financials are released at minimum every 12 months  

**If you are so open-source, why is there a 6 month delay?**  
We are currently in a cyber-arms race. Some clients may be deterred by the prospect of everything we do being open-source, they may have stringent security requirements. We aim to satisfy all clients' needs by keeping our work confidential until the project is complete, and then having a 6 month-delay. This way the client gets the upside of open-source support, whenever they want it, and exclusive first-time use.
