# project rootNoob Deus (Q)  
initially focussing on Qubes development (hence the Q)  

Development with a radically different business model*.  
We charge only for the 'time-target bonus' - everything else is on a cost-basis.  

However, there is one important caveat:  
*all of our work done must be public and open-source with non-restrictive licences.  

We do also offer consultancy (capped at 10% of deu man hours) - at extortionate prices.
