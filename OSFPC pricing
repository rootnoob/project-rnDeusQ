As this is for-profit, and we are a fast-paced company - we currenyl haven't got a stable enough formula to publish for our OS FP Consultancy pricing.  

We do however publish the developer hours, our costs and profits for all jobs done - so don't worry about sudden price fluctuations.  

The costings will be agreed in advance, there will be no sneaky hidden clauses.  


All we can definitely say is this:  
Our OSFPC pricing is extortionate, and you probably can't afford us.
