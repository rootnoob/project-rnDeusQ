<h1>Each @developer</h1>

Has their own directory, where they must place any of their specific documentation.  
We have standard team formats which we require to be conformed to for certain files.  

E.g: A standard format for the tools you use - but you don't have to use the team tools (the team tools is simply a compilation of users individual files, hence the need for a standard format).
